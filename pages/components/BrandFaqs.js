        { question: "Do your services include research when needed?", answer: "Yes. For non-fiction, biographies, or educational books, research is included. We don’t overdo it though. Just enough to support the story or message properly." },

        { question: "How is pricing decided for different writing services?", answer: "Pricing depends on word count, genre, complexity, and timeline. A short story is not priced like a full book. We explain costs clearly before starting. No hidden stuff." },

        { question: "Are these services suitable for first-time authors?", answer: "Very much. Many clients are writing their first book. We explain things slowly, answer small questions, and don’t assume you already know the publishing or writing world." },

        { question: "What if I’m not sure which writing service I need?", answer: "That happens a lot. You can explain your idea and goal, and we guide you. We’ll suggest the right service instead of pushing something that doesn’t fit." },
        
        { question: "Can I choose only one service instead of a full package?", answer: "Although we offer affordable book writing packages. But yes, you can choose. Some clients only need writing, others editing, some just refinement. You don’t have to buy everything. We keep services flexible. Not forced bundles." },

        { question: "How do revisions work across different writing services?", answer: "Revisions are part of the process. After each draft, you review and share thoughts. We revise based on that. Sometimes it takes one round, sometimes two or three. That’s normal." }
